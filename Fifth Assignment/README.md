steps to set up a node.js server

1. Installing Node.js: Visit the official Node.js website and download the installer for your operating system. Follow the installation instructions to set up Node.js on your computer.

2. Initializing a new project: Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to create your project. Run `npm init -y` to initialize a new Node.js project with default settings.

3. Installing necessary packages: Install required packages using npm. For setting up a basic server, you'll need the `express` package. Run `npm install express` to install Express and save it as a dependency in your `package.json` file.

4. Using Express for server setup: Express is a web framework for Node.js that simplifies the process of creating robust web applications. It provides features like routing, middleware support, and template engines. You can set up a basic server using Express like this:

   const express = require('express');
   const app = express();
   const PORT = 3000;

   app.get('/', (req, res) => {
       res.send('Hello World!');
   });

   app.listen(PORT, () => {
       console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${PORT}`);
   });

5. Using Nodemon for development: Nodemon is a utility that monitors changes in your Node.js application and automatically restarts the server whenever changes are detected. It aids in the development process by saving you the hassle of manually restarting the server after every code change. Install nodemon globally by running `npm install -g nodemon`. Then, start your server using `nodemon app.js` instead of `node app.js`.
